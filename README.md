Amiko is eager to contribute to open source projects, but she's found the process of looking for them on GitHub to be time-consuming and tedious. So she's started working on a web app that will search GitHub for open source projects with open issues and pull requests.


## Usage
The User will have the ability to search for repos by username, filter repos by HTML, JS, and or CSS. Additionally, the User will be able to view open and not repos associated with the github user.
